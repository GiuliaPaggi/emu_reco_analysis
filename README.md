# Macros used in reconstruction of emulsion data for SND@LHC

Using FEDRA ROOT C++ libraries

The Folder are organized as follows:

* run0analysis, run1analysis: collection of codes dedicated to this particular set of studies, included the used scanning, analysis parameters;

* quality_check: codes for quality checks of raw and reconstructed data;

* linking: codes with linking parameters and to analyze couples;

* tracking: codes to analyze track distributions, along with the most recent used track parameters;

* vertexing: codes for vertices;
